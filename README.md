# FRUIT-RIPENING-AND-CAROTENOIDS
Spectral and nutritional changes during fruit ripening in Prunus serotina and their ecological relevance for frugivore attraction and seed dispersal.

**"The Color of Attraction: Carotenoid-Based Coloration in the Black Cherry (*Prunus serotina*) Fruit Ripening and Its Interaction with the Grey Silky-Flycatcher (*Ptiliogonys cinereus*)"**.

##  Overview

The study explores how ripening-related changes in fruit coloration, nutritional composition, and frugivore behavior are integrated in a mutualistic system involving *Prunus serotina* and *Ptiliogonys cinereus*. The work includes data from two contrasting sites in central Mexico.

## Repository structure

- `data/` – CSV files containing data for carotenoids, fruit color, nutritional analysis, and seed germination.
- `figures/` – Final figures used in the manuscript.
- `scripts/` – R script for spectral analysis, nutrients analysis, germination modeling, and figure generation.

## Requirements

Scripts were written and tested in R 4.2.0. Required packages include:
- `ggplot2`
- `mgcv`
- `survival`
- `dplyr`
- `readr`

## Data files

- `Carotenoids.csv`: Endocarp carotenoid concentrations at different ripening stages.
- `ColorsInTrees.csv`: Reflectance measurements from fruits on monitored trees.
- `tree_a29_full_data.csv`: Comprehensive tracking of fruit development of the tree a29 from REPSA.
- `Nutrients.csv`: Macronutrient and antioxidant data per ripening stage.
- `Germination.csv`: Germination success and timing by ripening stage.
